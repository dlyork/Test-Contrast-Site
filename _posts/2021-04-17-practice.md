title: Predicting Neighborhood Change
subtitle: This chapter discusses the modeling of neighborhood change
---

Overview
========

<font size = "5"> The following page will discuss the impact that
college education, marital status, birthplace, and unemployment status
have on changes to home values between 2000 and 2010. Correlation plots
and statistic charts were used to determine skew and multicollinearity
to help eliminate possible bias. As the results will show, an R-squared
score of 0.48 was achieved using the variables mentioned above, which
warrants further investigation into neighborhood change. The following
list describes the results of the model.

```r

 * For each 1% increase in unemployment, median home values are
    expected to decrease by -$2,936.80.

 * For each 1% increase in college education, median home values are
    expected to increase by $18,393.49.

 * For each 1% increase in foreign born individuals, median home values
    are expected to decrease by -$1,778.96.

 * For each 1% increase in married couples, median home values are
    expected to decrease by -$9,651.48.

Representing House Value Changes
================================

<font size = "5"> To achieve the following results, data was used from
the 2000 and 2010 data sets, as well as a source file (York 2021b). To
get an accurate account of median house values between 2000 and 2010, an
inflation rate of 1.28855 was applied to house values in 2000.
Furthermore, changes in housing values were determined by the difference
between values in 2010 and 2000. Additionally, tracts with values less
than $10,000 and tracts with growth rates greater than 200% were
filtered out. It is likely that these tracts were plots of land that
developed. The following table displays the summary statistics for the
housing values in 2000 and 2010. </font>

```r
    # adjust 2000 home values for inflation 
    mhv_00 <- d$mhmval00 * 1.28855
    mhv_10 <- d$mhmval12

    # change in MHV in dollars
    mhv_change <- mhv_10 - mhv_00

    # drop low 2000 median home values
    # to avoid unrealistic growth rates.
    #
    # tracts with homes that cost less than
    # $10,000 are outliers
    mhv_00[ mhv_00 < 10000 ] <- NA

    # change in MHV in percent
    mhv_growth <- 100 * ( mhv_change / mhv_00 )

    #tracts with growth rates greater than
    # 200 percent
    mhv_growth[mhv_growth > 200] <- NA

Predicting MHV Change
=====================

<font size = "5"> To predict housing value changes in this example,
marital status, employment status, birthplace, and college education
were used. These variables were chosen because they may influence
housing prices. For example, one would assume that college education has
an impact on house prices because a better degree may lead to higher
income and the ability to afford a more expensive house. On the other
hand, unemployment status may mean that individuals cannot afford
expensive homes and tend to locate to areas with cheaper prices. That
being said, models were created to view the impact that these variables
have on housing prices. Please note that the variables mentioned above
were logged to help avoid spurious relationships. The following
correlation plot shows the relationships between the variables and
median housing change.</font>

```r
    # View correlation between variables
    d_select <- select( d_reg, mhv_change, p_col, p_fb, p_unemp, p_mar )

    # reduce data density for visualization
    set.seed( 1234 )
    d_cor <- sample_n( d_select, 10000 ) %>% na.omit()

    # correlation plots
    pairs( d_cor, upper.panel=panel_cor, lower.panel=panel_smooth )
```

<font size = "5"> Similar to the correlation plot above, a correlogram
was constructed below to further show the relationship between
variables. In this case, the squares represent the strength of the
correlation. In this case, unemployment appears to have little to no
correlation with mhv change. On the other hand, college education and
birthplace have a stronger correlation to mhv change. An important thing
to note is that none of the selected variables have a correlation
greater than 0.7 with each other. This indicates that multicollinearity
may not pose a problem for future models. </font>

```r
    # create correlation matrix for corrplot
    d_select_cor <- cor(d_cor)

    corrplot(d_select_cor, type = "upper", 
             addCoef.col = "black", method = "square", 
             tl.col="black" )
```

Modeling
========

<font size = "5"> Now that the relationships between variables have been
determined, models can be constructed to view the impact on housing
changes that occurred between 2000 and 2010. The chart below shows seven
models. The first two show the impact that unemployment and college
education have on housing changes, and the last three models encompass
all the variables. Furthermore, seventh considers growth in metros. By
controlling for metros, bias is being removed since not all metros are
going to experience changes the same way. </font>

```r
    stargazer( m1, m2, m3, m4, m5, m6, m7, 
               type=S_TYPE, digits=2,
               omit.stat = c("rsq","f"),
               omit="cbsa",
               add.lines = list(c("Metro Fixed Effects:", "NO", "NO", "NO", "NO", "No", "NO","YES")) )

What Does It All Mean?
======================

<font size = "5"> As previously mentioned, the above models show the
impact that marriage, employment, birthplace, and education have on
housing value changes. Note that there were no significant increases in
standard errors, and the R-squared values did increase with the addition
of all variables. This shows that the last model did improve. The
resulting R-Squared was 0.48, which is not great and indicates that
further variables should be considered for predicting housing value
changes. In the case of these models, the variable that showed to have
the biggest influence was college education, while unemployment did not
contribute as much as its counterparts. Unemployment may not have as big
of an influence because those unemployed may not have a desire to move
because of their financial situation. However, this should be further
explored. Surprisingly, marital status did not have as big of an impact
as theorized. Similar to unemployment status, marital status should be
further investigated. The following list describes the results of the
model.

* For each 1% increase in unemployment, median home values are
    expected to decrease by -$2,936.80.

* For each 1% increase in college education, median home values are
    expected to increase by $18,393.49.

* For each 1% increase in foreign born individuals, median home values
    are expected to decrease by -$1,778.96.

* For each 1% increase in married couples, median home values are
    expected to decrease by -$9,651.48.

Overall, many different factors could indicate housing value changes. In
the future, other variables should be added to the above models to
improve accuracy. </font>
